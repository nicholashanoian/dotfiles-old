#+TITLE: Manjaro i3 Setup

* About

This repository is used to set up Manjaro i3 to my liking.

* Installation

To install:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -Lks bit.do/nhh-cfg | /bin/bash
#+END_SRC

This will clone the bare repository to =~/.nhh-config= and copy the relevant configuration files to the home directory. It will also copy a few useful scripts to the =~/nhh-install= directory. Use the following scripts to install the packages and programs that I use most frequently.

- =pacman.sh= :: installs normal packages
- =yaourt.sh= :: installs aur packages
- =oh-my-zsh.sh= :: installs =oh-my-zsh=
- =venv.sh= :: installs =virtualenvwrapper= and creates a new virtual environment called =py3=
